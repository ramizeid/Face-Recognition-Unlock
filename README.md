# Face-Recognition-Unlocker
- When setting up the software, the user provides this technology with a few pictures of him/her, which are then added to a database stored on the user's machine
- This technology uses the OpenCV Python library in order to recognize a user's facial features and compare them to the pictures stored in the local database. If the latter match, the machine unlocks
- Please note that this project is still in its early stages. Updates will be made regularly
