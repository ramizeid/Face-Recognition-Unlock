# Face-Recognition-Unlocker
- Please change the "FACES LOCATION" text in the main.py file to the faces database location
- When setting up the software, the user provides this technology with a few pictures of him/her, which are then added to a database stored on the user's machine
- This technology uses the OpenCV Python Library in order to recognize a user's facial features and compare them to the pictures stored in the local database. If the latter match, the machine unlocks
- For the time being, the software uses an artificial intelligence system developed by me. However, I intend on using the TensorFlow library in the future due to its higher levels of precision when it comes to face detection
- Please note that this project is still in its early stages. Updates will be made regularly
